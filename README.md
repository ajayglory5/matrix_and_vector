# matrix_and_vector
This is a C++ program, that has two class. One class is a matrix class while another is a vector class. These classes supports the following:
* Cross product of two vectors
* Product of two given matrix
* Multiplication of a given matrix and a given vector
* Scaling of the given vector/matrix
* Addition of two given vectors/matrix
* Subtraction of two given vectors/matrix
* No linear algebra functions are sought for (e.g. inverse, linear solving, svd etc.).

# steps to compile and run
* Unzip the package.

* Go inside the package:
```
cd matrix_and_vector/
```

* Now create a temporary build directorsy to compile. Execute the following command:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
```
* You may have to do the following steps if cmake command above fails:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

* To execute the unit testcases, run the following command:
```
./test/matrix_and_vector_test
```
This should give the output as:
```

* To check for memory leaks, run the following command (install valgrind if required):
```
valgrind ./test/matrix_and_vector_test
```
This should give the output as:
